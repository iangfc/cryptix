/**
 * <p>This project includes crypto code that was produced for the
 * 4th generation WebFunds project.  The intent is to put all
 * of the crypto code into a separate library so it is a bit
 * clearer what is done and what is available.</p>
 * 
 * <p>It is not recommended that you follow this style.  It is
 * far better for your application to copy in the parts you need,
 * customise and tune them, then carry on.  Crypto is integral
 * to your application and isolating and extracting it
 * into libraries can bite back.
 * (Note that does not apply to WebFunds because we maintain
 * both code bases in parallel and are at liberty to fold it
 * all in again...)</p>
 * 
 * <p>As well as crypto code it includes a small amount of support
 * code in cryptix.util.  That's unfortunate but essential to write
 * the various testing and interactions needed.</p>
 * 
 * <h2> Permission to use </h2>
 * <p>The original code in this library is licensed under a
 * free-speech all-you-can-eat public-domain airdrop.</p>
 * 
 * <ul><li>You are free to speak this code any way you wish or need.</ul>
 * <li>Attribution is nice but not necessary.</ul>
 * <li>Nothing is warranteed, promised, guaranteed -- use at your
 * own risk and your own liability.</li></ul>
 * 
 * <h2> Dependencies </h2>
 * <p>There are no patented contents, to our knowledge, and we would
 * remove those with a vengeance.  Patents are a blight on the Internet.</p>
 * 
 * <p>There is some code copied or inspired from BouncyCastle
 * raw crypto library.
 * This is mostly the interface style and digests.
 * That code remains under their licence.</p>
 * 
 * <p>There are a few papers copied in here for convenience.
 * These are the copyright of the authors, but they are the
 * sort of paper that is meant to be copied around.  If in
 * doubt, check the home site by googling the title.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The library is entirely independent of all other libraries,
 * it requires no other code or library to be downloaded.
 * As it should be.</p>
 * 
 * <h2> History </h2>
 * <p>It uses the old Cryptix name in a vain hope to restart that
 * project after a decade of silence.</p>
 * 
 * <p>May your packets be secure.  Hack on!</p>
