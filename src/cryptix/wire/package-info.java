/**
 * <p>This is the WebFunds Wire system for doing Ouroboros serialisation
 * of general objects in an independent manner.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The pattern is documented herein in the working paper
 * OuroborosPattern.pdf which was prepared by Ada and Iang
 * in Summer 2012 as part of Ada's internship on CAcert code.
 * It describes the reasons and benefits of
 * the Ouroboros approach but <b>does not</b> seek to compare
 * and contrast with all the other frameworks out there.
 * People accustomed to other frameworks will find this odd.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This may not be appropriate place, but here for now.
 * Wire is one of those packages that is low-level, as low
 * as it gets, like Crypto and Utils.</p>
